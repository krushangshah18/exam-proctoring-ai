# ── Score bucket classification ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Keys listed here go into the NON-DECAYING (fixed) bucket — their score
# contribution never shrinks over the session.  All other keys go into the
# decaying bucket.
NON_DECAYING: set = {"tab_switch", "phone", "fake_presence", "multiple_people", "no_person"}

# ── Confidence gate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Global minimum confidence for scoring.  Per-key entries in SCORE_MIN_CONF
# take precedence.  Head/gaze events always pass confidence=1.0 so this only
# matters for YOLO-based events.
MIN_CONF: float = 0.5

    "phone"    : 0.60,    # matches YOLO phone detection threshold

    "headphone": 0.40,    # matches YOLO headphone threshold
    "earbud"   : 0.40,    # matches YOLO earbud threshold
}

# ── Risk-scoring cooldowns (seconds) ──────────────────────────────────────────
# Minimum gap between consecutive score additions for the same event.
# RULE: api_cooldown == score_cooldown (every score event fires an alert).
#       warn_cooldown <= score_cooldown (warning shows at least as often as scoring).
# Both live in alerts.py and must be kept in sync with these values.
